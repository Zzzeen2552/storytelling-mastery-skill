4. **Structure as Spine** — The architecture of story
5. **Transformation** — The arc of change

## The 7 Golden Rules

> **1.** Story lives or dies in the protagonist. Know your hero before anything else.
> **2.** Nothing begins until something is disrupted. Start there — not before.
> **3.** Conflict is not decoration. It is the engine. Remove it and there is no story.
> **4.** Know your structure before you write. A story without a spine is a puddle.
> **5.** If nothing changes, nothing has been said. Transformation is the point.
> **6.** Write from emotional truth. Technique without feeling is carpentry without purpose.
> **7.** Show what characters do under pressure. Pressure reveals. Description only decorates.
